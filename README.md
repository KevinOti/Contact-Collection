# Contact-Collection

Learning python takes concerted effort and the same can only be achieved through working on hands on projects, the last few week a leap was made and the decision was on working with projects to ensure the basic concepts as well as put to practices.

<h2>The project should do the following with relative ease</h2>

<i><h3>Adding contacts</h3></i>
This section should allow for adding of new contact information this includes, the First and Last name, Phone number and address, the phone number has to be unique to avoid conflict and observation of database rules, using the tkinter messagebox, a successfully message will be displayed in the case the information and correct otherwise one will required review the information before making the second attempt

<i><h3>Retrieving contacts</h3></i>
contacts need to be retrived once in a while as most of the time we dont have this contacts top of mind, the section will ease the process of retrieving the contact based on the first name type in, using the ILKE operator the same will be filtered and display information that was requested
